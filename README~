This is a little project that calculates water deficit for a
garden. The script uses the Weather Underground API, which requires an API key, 
which can be obtained at https://www.wunderground.com/. The script assumes that 
gardens need 1 in of rain per week 
(https://bonnieplants.com/library/how-much-water-do-vegetables-need/). The 
script then computes how much rain was received over the last three days and 
how much is expected in the next three days. The water deficit is the difference 
between what is needed and what was received/expected.
